# Requirements
## Introduction: 
In this C program, the user is prompted to choose the operations(i.e. addition, subtraction etc)  to be performed and then prompted to key in the values which are used to perform the operations.Then, the result will be shown as output to the user.
The tool used for writing the code in this project is visual studio code.
## Research:
Calculators are part and parcel of modern education. Involvement of science and engineering in different fields of knowledge is increasing with each bit of time is passed by, and they are playing a role in description and characterization of the delicate phenomena of nature arising day by day. These fields of knowledge and mathematics in particular, are influencing even those distant branches of knowledge, which were so far imagined to be free of mathematics. Even art is not free of mathematics and there exists mathematical art. Computations are getting lengthy and complex specially in design and analysis of engineering systems. Scientific calculators are handy tools. But an efficient computation is a skill that can be developed.
Use of a calculator at home to figure out your monthly budget, or when you're trying to cook a new recipe. This technology allows students solve complicated problems quickly and in an efficient manner. Additionally, it can reduce the problem to simpler tasks and allows the student to devote more time in understanding the problem. Secondly, they are saved from monotonous calculations and the same boring mundane procedure.
It is almost impossible for us to imagine mathematics without something as seemingly simple as a calculator.
Calculators have not only greatly enhanced our ability to perform the regular computations that are involved in everyday life, but provided humans with the ability to understand mathematics on a greater scale than ever imagined. 
## SWOT analysis:
### Strengths:
Accurate, User-friendly.
### Weakness:
Dependency, Cheating, Relying too much on calculator.
### Opportunities:
We know that we mostly use pen and paper for calculation, calculators can reduce the problem to simpler tasks.
### Threats:
Relying on a calculator results in a child being unable to progress in math due to lack of fluency and recall of facts.

## 4'W and 1'H
### What: 
Calculator
### Where:
School, shops, industries, pharmacy.
### When:
Need for calculation.
### How:
Calculates the user input based on required operation and gives the output.
