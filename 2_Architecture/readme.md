# Behavior Diagram
Behavior diagrams show the dynamic behavior of the objects in a system, which can be described as a series of changes to the system over time.

# Structure Diagram
Structure diagrams show static structure of the system and its parts on different abstraction and implementation levels and how those parts are related to each other. The elements in a structure diagram represent the meaningful concepts of a system, and may include abstract, real world and implementation concepts.
